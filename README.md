# JS_Play

JS_Play is a collection of personal JS libraries that I coded.

LocalFirstage I think is useful, and I would like to change it into an open source project.  The way I do dependency injection for ES6 modules is a new concept, but I don't know how useful it is (other than for academic learning purposes).

The others are reinventions of the wheel - good for demonstrations and learning.

	Dependency injection for ES6 modules
	River - a Functional Reactive Programming library
		- a la Bacon.js, RxJS
	Unit test framework
		- what my tests are written in
		- does async testing, also
	Visitor, ReadWriteStream (with indent and un-indent), and PrintVisitor
		- good for pretty printing
	LocalFirstage - offline-first database with same API as localForage
		- good when you want fast searching of your whole database
